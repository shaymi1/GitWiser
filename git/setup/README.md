# Setup GIT
For working locally on your laptop (or desktop) with GIT, whatever OS (operation system - Windows, Linux, OSx) you need to install it. The best way to do it is to follow the instructions in this page: https://git-scm.com/downloads.

Once you have GIT installed locally, you should configure it for your user, by running a first GIT command: [git config](../../git/commands/git-config.md). For now, there is no need to learn the full usage of that command. You just need to run it as follow.

Run the following 2 commands in your terminal/GitBash/CMD window:
```
git config --global user.name "<your display name>"
git config --global user.email <your email address>
```

This is important step and you should not skip it. It is necessary for any future [git commit](../../git/commands/git-commit.md) you'll perform. If you have more than one GIT account, the [git config command](../../git/commands/git-config.md) should be used differently. This use-case will not be detailed here.

# Setup GitHub
If you don't have a GitHub user, you should sign-up here: https://github.com/join.

Once you have a GitUser, it is best that you'll work in SSH mode (instead of HTTPS), so please [generate a SSH key](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys), and add it to your profile [SSH-keys page](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

# Setup GitWiser
Either you're using the https://github.com/yorammi/GitWiser repository for reference, knowledge-base, GIT-learning, workshop or even contributing to it, it is recommended to [fork it](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) first, and work with the forked repository.

Once you have a forked repository, clone it locally to your laptop (better use the SSH URL instead of the HTTPS URL!), and then you are all setup for work.

**Don't forget to [star](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/saving-repositories-with-stars) the original [WiseCommunity/GitWiser](https://github.com/WiseCommunity/GitWiser) repository!**
