# GitWiser name and logo

The name GitWiser is something I made as a cross-words of 'GIT', 'get' and 'wiser'. I've googled about it and found no previous usage of it, but if it is a property of something, please let [me](yorammi@gmail.com) know.

The GitWiser logo is a also a mix of 2 images:
* GIT logo - originated from this file: https://files.geektime.co.il/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/git-logo.png
* Chess queen image - originated from this file: https://purepng.com/public/uploads/large/purepng.com-chesschesstwo-playerchessboardgameboard88-grid-170152813449719q4e.png
